# Random Password Generator - Week - 3 - Challenge

## Description

This is a small functioning random password generator. The project itself is useful for everyone, because today almost everyone is carrying confidential financial information stored in their phone/laptops, but specially organizations that are managing confidential information and are required to have secure passwords for their ids. For me, the main purpose of this project was to work on my newfound JavaScript skills. In the very end, I collaborated with Mansi from AskBCSlearning assistant on slack to make the writePassword function work.
